# Rick and Morty Flutter App

This repository contains a simple Flutter app that loads characters from the **Rick & Morty API**, supports favorites, local caching (Hive), and pagination.

> I added two demo videos showing the app running on Android and iPhone. Place them under `assets/videos/` as:
>
> * `assets/videos/android_demo.mp4`
> * `assets/videos/iphone_demo.mp4`
